TEMU uses Automake and Autoconf, so the basic recipe for compiling it
is:

% ./configure --target-list=i386-softmmu --cc=gcc-3.4 --proj-name=tracecap
% make

Where "tracecap" is the name of the plugin you want to build.
("qemu-doc" in this directory describes the generic QEMU build process.)

For more details, including prerequisite packages, see
docs/install-temu-release.sh or Section 2 ("Installation") of the TEMU
user manual.
