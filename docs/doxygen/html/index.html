TEMU Overview</a></h2>
TEMU is a whole-system dynamic binary analysis platform that we developed on the basis of a whole-system emulator, QEMU. We run an entire system, including the operating system and applications in this emulator, and observe in a fine-grained manner how the binary code of interest is executed. The whole-system approach in TEMU is motivated by several considerations:<p>
<ul>
<li>
Many analyses require fine-grained instrumentation (i.e., at instruction level) on binary code. By dynamically translating the emulated code, the whole-system emulator enables fine-grained instrumentation.<p>
</li>
<li>
Whole-system emulator presents us a whole-system view. The whole-system view enables us to analyze the operating system kernel and interactions between multiple processes. In contrast, many other binary analysis tools (e.g., Valgrind, DynamoRIO, Pin) only provide a local view (i.e., a view of a single user-mode process). This is particularly important for analyzing malicious code, because many attacks involve multiple processes, and kernel attacks such as rootkits have become increasingly popular.<p>
</li>
<li>
A whole-system emulator provides an excellent isolation between the analysis components and the code under analysis. As a result, it is more difficult for the code under analysis to interfere with analysis results. </li>
</ul>
<p>
The design of TEMU is motivated by several challenges and considerations: <ul>
<li>
The whole-system emulator only provides us only the hardware-level view of the emulated system, whereas we need a software-level view to get meaningful analysis results. Therefore, we need a mechanism that can extract the OS-level semantics from the emulated system. For example, we need to know what process is currently running and what module an instruction comes from.<p>
</li>
<li>
In addition, many analyses require reasoning about how specific data depends on its data sources and how it propagates throughout the system. We enable this using whole-system dynamic taint analysis.<p>
</li>
<li>
We need to provide a well-designed programming interface (i.e., API) for users to implement their own plugins on TEMU to perform their customized analysis. Such an interface can hide unnecessary details from users and reuse the common functionalities.<p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p>
With these considerations in mind, we have designed the architecture of TEMU, as shown in the figure above. We build the {<em>semantics</em> extractor} to extract OS-level semantics information from the emulated system. We build the {<em>taint</em> analysis engine} to perform dynamic taint analysis. We define and implement an interface (i.e, TEMU API) for users to easily implement their own analysis modules (i.e. TEMU plugins). These modules can be loaded and unloaded at runtime to perform designated analyses. We implemented TEMU in Linux, and at the time of writing, TEMU can be used to analyze binary code in Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Linux systems. Below we describe these three components respectively.<h2><a class="anchor" name="main_overview">
