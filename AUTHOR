The BitBlaze Team is a research group led by Professor Dawn Song at
University of California, Berkeley, developing technologies for
analyzing program binaries for security applications. The past and
current student and staff members who have contributed to this release
include David Brumley, Juan Caballero, Cody Hartwig, Ivan Jager, Min
Gyung Kang, Zhenkai Liang, Stephen McCamant, James Newsome, Pongsin
Poosankam, Prateek Saxena, Heng Yin, and Jiang Zheng.

In particular, Heng Yin is the key developer of the TEMU component,
and Zhenkai Liang, Cody Hartwig and Stephen McCamant also contributed
to parts of the code. Juan Caballero developed tracecap, a TEMU plugin
to collect execution traces, based on an earlier trace collection
plugin developed by Zhenkai Liang.

TEMU is based on the open-source whole-system emulator QEMU.
